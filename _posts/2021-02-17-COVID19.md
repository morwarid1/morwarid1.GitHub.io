Context | Objectives  | Key Analysis
------------ | -------------  | ------------- 
From World Health Organization â€“ On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several Cases of Pneumonia in Wuhan City, China. The virus did not match any other virus. It raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease. These virus cases in the U.S. are stacking up higher and higher. Understanding this virus is crucial to stop its spread. In this case study, we will be exploring ways to prevent the further spread of this virus by using vaccines.  | As an analyst, my task is to find which states need urgent vaccinations and medical services. Vaccinations of COVID-19 in the U.S. will begin on Dec.14, 2020. This case study will identify the vulnerable Age Groups and top 10 States for vaccinations. The Key analyses are the following:|- 1.Explore the change in Confirmed and Death Cases of COVID-19 by States.- 2. Explore the time series of Confirmed and Deaths Cases of COVID-19 by months.- 3. Does Gender play a role in Death Cases of COVID-19? - 4. Which age groups are the vulnerable populations in COVID-19 Cases? - 5. What are the top 10 states with the highest number of vulnerable populations? - 6. Understand the relationship between Confirmed Cases and Deaths Cases by State.- 7. What further strategies should be used to stop spreading the COVID-19 cases?


TOOLS USED | 
------------ | 
Importing libraries (Python) |
Importing, exporting, and Combining datasets (Python) |
Data Consistency Checks (Python) |
Descriptive Analysis (Python) |
Data wrangling and Merging (Python) |
Deriving New Variables (Python) |
Grouping Data and Aggregating Variables (Python) |

### Process

Step 1: Data preparation | Step 2: Analyzing data | Step 3: Visualization of the data 
------------ | ------------- | -------------|
Searched for the right Data| Supervised machines learning: Regression analysis| Mapping the data|
Cleaned the Data (merging, grouping, aggregating, etc.) | Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering analysis |Line charts, Bar charts, Pies Charts, etc.|
Create new variables to glean insights | Time-series Analysis | Creating a Data Dashboard |

Challanges | Solutions
------------ | -------------
I had a hard time merging Large data in Jupyter Notebook. The KERNAL of Jupyter slowed down dramatically and would not save my work.| I updated Anaconda and Python libraries through Terminal. This process helped me better understand Terminal usage.
