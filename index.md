## About Me
My name is Morwarid Najafizada. I am a self-directed certified data analyst from CareerFoundry boot camp. And I am 4th year Business Analytics student at the Telfer school of management. I call myself a passionate data analyst because I love problem-solving, analyzing, and researching data. I love this field because it allows me to be creative with the data and create my interpretation of the data. I find the process very engaging and satisfactory because I get to showcase my result at the end.

I have volunteered in different organizations. And I was applauded for being a detail-oriented and innovative employee. Now, I am ready to contribute my skills as a passionate data analyst to a professional services firm. And contribute to helping better serve clients in making data-driven decisions and add value for the cross-functional business team.
